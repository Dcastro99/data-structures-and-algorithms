## Approach & Efficiency

I iterate through each node.

## Solution

 > ### Append:

- append will take in and item.
check the beginning of the linked list.
iterate through the list and when list returns undefined, it appends new node

> ### Insert before

- we check the linked list for an existing node. the while loop will iterate through the list until found and insert new node to list.

> ### Insert after

- wile loop will iterate through existing list until node found and insert new node to the list
