# Reverse an Array
I had to verbalize the process in which I was going to code this problem out.

## Whiteboard Process
Having a 7 step process makes it a lot easier. i was able to have structure and understanding on how to approach the challenge.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used the process we were shown in class. First having a high view of the question followed by what inputs I was given and what outputs were expected. Then created a visiualization of the funtionality, next the pseudocode followed by actual code. Haven't explored the Big O just yet.
